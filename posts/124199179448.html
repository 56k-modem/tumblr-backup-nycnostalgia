<p><a href="http://route22ny.tumblr.com/post/124197664683/speaking-of-subways-this-corny-photo-supposedly" class="tumblr_blog">route22ny</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Speaking of subways, this corny photo supposedly shows the way-out ways New Yorkers were using to get around during the historic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_New_York_City_transit_strike">transit strike of January 1966</a>.  My dad was a motorman at the time, 3 round trips a night between Pelham and South Ferry.  (Going to work with him once and riding the train all night long was one of my best teenage memories.)  The strike dragged on a couple of dramatic weeks.  Subway riders expressed displeasure with the transit workers afterward.  One example was that newspapers that they’d previously leave on their subway seats for conductors (or motormen) to pick up later were now ripped in half.  After a while everything went back to normal, of course.  <i>New York Daily News</i> photo taken by George Lockhart.<br/></p></blockquote>
