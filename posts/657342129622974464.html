<h2><p>Wow!  Just found your Tumblr.  I've lived at 9th St & 2nd Ave since 1974.  The pics of the East Village and surrounding nabes was a trip down memory lane, alas most of it sorrowful.  The "East Village" is nearly dead.  There is a remnant of the 1970s-1980s vibrant culture left but mostly it has become a gentrified amusement park for NYU students and luxury condos.  Thanks for the memories.  Though it was rough in the bad old days, it had life & I miss it.</p></h2>
<p>Thanks for the thanks! And for sharing some memories. Yeah, NYC is never going to be as interesting as it was. Or as dangerous, so I guess that’s something too.</p>
