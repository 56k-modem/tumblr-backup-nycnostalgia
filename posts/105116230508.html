<h2>The stories involving burning houses in the Bronx in the 70's revolve around the properties being so useless, that the best financial decision they could do was to burn them so they collect the insurance money. Whether or not that was true for all cases, or even accurately explains the trend, well, I'm not sure. That's just what I've always heard it explained.</h2>
