<h2><p>Here's an obscure request. There was a park in Woodside or elmhurst that had a handball court with a full size painting of darkside of the moon on it. Cant find any images of it or remember where it was exactly.</p></h2>
<p>Doesn’t ring any bells for me. Anyone out there know about this?&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
