<h2>May I ask when were you born in NY? I was born in the early 1990s but I'm very much intrigued with the 1950s-1980s atmosphere of the city with its locally based food stores and old-school neighborhoods. Too bad it's now filled with overcrowded coffee shops and yoga studios with overpriced apartments. </h2>
<p>My formative years were the 70s and 80s, which is why most of my posts are focused on that era. NYC is definitely a different place now!</p>
