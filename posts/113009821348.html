<h2>Of all the places in NYC that are no longer there, which one would you bring back, if you could only bring back one? </h2>
<p>Ooh, good question! Three things spring to mind, but I guess I&rsquo;ll go with a string of bookstores on 18th Street in the early 1980s. I&rsquo;m cheating by counting these all as one thing, but I used to go to all of them, never just one. There were three awesome used bookstores on 18th between 5th and 6th Ave &ndash; they were small but packed full of fascinating stuff &ndash; and then there were the two Barnes &amp; Noble stores on 18th and 5th. The main B&amp;N was a marvel, filled with way more books than current day versions have, ridiculously great deals on remaindered books, as well as a massive textbook section that was fun to peruse. On the other side of 5th Ave was an almost equally huge B&amp;N with used books piled to the rafters. </p><p>Heaven.</p>
