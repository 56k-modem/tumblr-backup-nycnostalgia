<h2>hi there, I was looking at the picture that my nostalgia reblogged from you. the one of the twins with the caption New York City, Feb. 1973 by Alain Le Garsmeur. those are my great great aunts in that picture. I was wondering if you could tell me where you got it? thank you!  </h2>
<p>Holy crap! That&rsquo;s wild! I just reblogged it from here: http://k-a-t-i-e-.tumblr.com/post/105969818340 You&rsquo;d have to ask that person where they dug up the photo. Good luck!</p>
