<h2>Can you help me to remember the name of a restaurant I used to eat at in the 1950's?   The restaurant was in the Broadway area, probably on Broadway.  They served small roast beef sandwiches at the bar.  The distinctive feature of the bar was a revolving cartoon display.  I thought it might have been called McGuinness's but can't seem to verify that on the web?  Thanks!</h2>
<p>That doesn’t ring any bells for me. Anyone else remember this?</p>
