<h2>Hello! I've loved this blog for a long time, I think I discovered it while living in New York for an internship. Anyway, I've just moved to Philly and I was wondering if you knew of any blogs similar to this that are about Philadelphia? </h2>
<p>Thanks! Unfortunately, I don’t know of anything like it for any other cities. I’m sure they exist, though. Good luck tracking them down!</p>
