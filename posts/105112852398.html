<h2>What are some of the best, underrated places for a tourist to go on a trip to NY/NJ? I've wanted to go all my life and next year I'm going to, so I want to make the most of the trip. Places that locals love and tourists don't really know about would be welcome</h2>
<p>It depends on what sorts of things you&rsquo;re into. But in any case, unless you have a time machine I&rsquo;m probably the wrong person to ask. When I go back to NYC these days, the only place I&rsquo;m sure to visit is the Strand bookstore. Everything else in Manhattan seems like Disney and Starbucks had mutant babies. </p>
