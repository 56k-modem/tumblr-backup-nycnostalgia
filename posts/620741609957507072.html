<p>Looking down the tracks toward Manhattan and an approaching 7 train of Redbirds from 46th Street/Bliss Street westbound platform, with a really really good view of the signal.  Above the oncoming train is the silhouette of the Empire State Building.  A more mundane but infinitely more helpful detail is the Center Theater visible a couple of blocks away down on Queens Boulevard: the photo still retained enough sharpness to see that “Pet Sematary” was showing, enabling this photo, just scanned today, to be dated as 1989.</p>
<p>Currently the New York Transit Museum is paying tribute to the Redbirds with an exhibit marking their 60th anniversary with an exhibit called “<a href="https://untappedcities.com/2019/11/12/reign-of-the-redbirds-exhibit-celebrates-the-60th-anniversary-of-the-redbird-subway-cars/">Reign of the Redbirds</a>,” running until September 2020.  What was the attraction of these cars?  
“Boxy and industrial-looking, these vehicles became synonymous with New York City and are as iconic as the subway token.”

<p>In <i>Subway Memories</i>, 
Camilo José Vergara

 spoke with transit workers about the Redbirds: “They were supposed to be the worst subway cars and proved to be the best; they required little maintenance,” said one.  A historian likened them to the Model T Ford: “The Ford Model T had once been called an underdog and an ugly duckling, but it became endearing through its endurance.  Machines like that are loved because everyday people who make things work project themselves onto them.”<br/></p>
