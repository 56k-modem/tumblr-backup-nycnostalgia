<h2>Hello! My name is Robin Sayers, and I'm the editor of NYU's alumni magazine. We're dying over the image you posted on September 1, 2014 w/ the kids in the playground near NYU in 1975.  We're wondering, if we ran it, do you have a high-resolution file of it, or could we very carefully scan the original, or do you know who owns the rights? Thank you so much for any help. I love you website! Sincerely, Robin</h2>
<p>Hi Robin. That great photo isn’t mine. I dug it up from here, I believe:</p><p><a href="http://sohomemory.com/2014/04/01/triple-take/">http://sohomemory.com/2014/04/01/triple-take/</a><br/></p><p>Maybe they have the original or know who does? Good luck!</p>
