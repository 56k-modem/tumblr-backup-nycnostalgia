<h2>What's your favorite thing about living in Manhattan?(Food, Entertainment, tourist attractions, the people, etc.)</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t live in Manhattan anymore, but when I was there my favorite things were the bookstores (there used to be a ton of used bookstores, along with another ton of indie bookstores that were awesome), the pizza, and being able to walk anywhere I needed to go. </p>
