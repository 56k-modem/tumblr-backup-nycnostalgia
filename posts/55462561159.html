<p>Holy shit, I remember this lady! Pretty sure she was blind, and she played a really shitty accordion. She was a regular on the subways. In the 70s, us kids were taught that beggars and bums were dangerous psychopaths and that if you gave them money they&rsquo;d go and shoot heroin into their feet. I don&rsquo;t think this lady was hooked on H, but I never did get a good look at her feet to look for track marks.</p>
