<h2>Respectfully, is this nostalgia? The city was bankrupt, crime was rampant, the city was filthy, graffiti all over the place and the butt of jokes across these United States. I came up in this NYC - I'd forgotten how disgusting it was - when you're young, you don't notice these things. Nevertheless, you have some very interesting shots and I wish you every success with your blog. - Sincerely, Jonathan O. </h2>
<p>The object of nostalgia isn’t always pretty. Or at least, the object of nostalgia isn’t always pretty to everyone besides the one who is being nostalgic. NYC was everything you say, and yet I’m still nostalgic for it. What can I do?</p>
