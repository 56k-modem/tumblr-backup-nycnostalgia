<h2><p>You're seriously the coolest human I've come across in a long time. I actually found you while searching on Google for old school pics of the UWS for my husband. You're literally the only reason why I even signed up for social media. We're enjoying your art very much and wish you all the best. Keep it coming my dude. Much love & respect. </p></h2>
<p>Oh damn, thank you so much! Always glad when people have a fun nostalgic time here!</p>
