<h2>my mom used to live in brooklyn (i think) in the 80s, we talked about it a lot a few days ago. she said it was like living in a nightmare. it was also her first time in america and her english wasn't so good so that has something to do with it. anyways she said it was horrible but she still loved living there somehow</h2>
