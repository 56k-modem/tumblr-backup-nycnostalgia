<h2>thank you for this blog. i just spent way too long in your uws tag and i feel like that good kind of upset when you remember exactly what stores and places used to be where, even if a majority of the photos are from before i was born. if you ever did any posts for 110th st and morningside heights pre-gentrification that would be amazing (for me personally anyway). thank you again!</h2>
<p>Glad you’re having a good, nostalgic time! Thanks!</p>
