<h2>As you're a fanatic of the upcoming/grit of NYC in past times. I'm curious to know your thoughts on 5pointz as it was called? and the fact the real estate decided to clean it up? As a person who never visited NYC but massively follow the Graffiti scene 5pointz to me was an iconic capture of what i imagined NYC to be like in the 70s/80s era. Love the blog also, its great seeing the city post modern era. </h2>
<p>I was a Manhattan/Bronx kid &ndash; didn’t know much about 5pointz.</p>
