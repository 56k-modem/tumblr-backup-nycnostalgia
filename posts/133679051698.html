<h2>I've been curious about your photo posted 12/3/2014, titled "What the hell was he just doing???" -- Do you know where exactly was this picture taken? The woman partly obscures the sign but it appears to say either Queensboro Ave. or Queensborough Ave. I've never heard of an NYC street or subway station by that name and nothing at the various NYC subway history sites shows a station by that name. Also, what the heck is *she* doing with her right hand? Hah...</h2>
<p>I’m not sure where it is, but I’m almost positive it’s midtown Manhattan. I think the sign actually reads “Queensboro - 8th Ave”, as seen on this retro sign they made for Men In Black: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/retro-subway-signs-dot-brooklyn-stations-men-black-iii-filming-article-1.147020">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/retro-subway-signs-dot-brooklyn-stations-men-black-iii-filming-article-1.147020</a></p><p>What happens in your pocket stays in your pocket&hellip;</p>
