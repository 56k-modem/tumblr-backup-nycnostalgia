<h2>regarding your picture today (Dec 12) "Chillin’ on Broadway and 88th, 1976" -- I don't understand WHY you failed to provide a full biography on the six elderly people in the shot; whether or not the storefronts on the street are still in business and IF NOT what happened to each; how much the average taxi ride cost that year; the history/manufacturer of the bench the pensioners are sitting on; and the barometric pressure for the day & time the photo was shot. Please try harder. Thank You!</h2>
<p>I know, I totally suck!</p>
