<p>To those of you who give a shit about sources, references, footnotes, bibliographies, and all that: Why don’t you just leave me alone and go get your PhDs in photo-sourcing?</p><p>This is a Tumblr blog. A fucking Tumblr blog. It is not connected with Harvard University’s library system, and is not meant to be a scholarly resource. It’s just a bunch of cool images I found on the web and otherwhere. I am not going to fact-check the veracity of the info provided by otherwhere; I am not going to provide links back to otherwhere; I am not going to turn this blog into a well-organized repository. That’s a lot of work that nobody’s paying me to do. </p><p>One easy option is for you to go away. Leave me alone. </p><p>Another option is to start a campaign to shut this blog down because I don’t live up to your expectations.</p><p>Your third option is to enjoy the pretty pictures and hang out with me while I get all nostalgic about the NYC I used to know.</p><p>I don’t give a shit which option you choose. But I do wish you’d stop complaining. </p><p>(Thanks, by the way, to all of you who are just hanging out with me and enjoying yourselves. I like you a lot.)</p>
