<h2>Hi! Your blog is "top-shelf." You deserve an award.  I love books, and I love museums, but I don't believe a book or museum could represent this truly one-of-a-kind beautiful historic collection of New York City photographs you've been respectably putting together.  Thanks for sharing and thanks for your hard work, and keep your collection growing the future world will refer to your blog for many years to come.</h2>
<p>Thanks!</p>
