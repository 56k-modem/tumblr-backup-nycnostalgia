<h2><p>Your collection of photos is amazing - thanks for doing this! I was a horse-drawn carriage driver in Central Park for 4 years in the early 70s and don't have a single photo of myself doing it - hoping to find me here somewhere! The stable was on 38th between 10th and 11th Avenue and every day I drove the carriage right through Times Square, in all it's gritty glory.</p></h2>
<p>Wow, that must’ve been a trip and a half!</p>
