<h2>Did you live in manhattan in the 70s? If so, how was it like? </h2>
<p>Yeah, it was a scary but interesting place. I got mugged so much that I figured out how to talk muggers into taking only half of my money, so I&rsquo;d have something for the next muggers. But I was never bored, and you didn&rsquo;t have to be rich to have a decent life there.</p>
