<h2>Perhaps the previous anon wanted to see pictures of Peppermint Park?  It was an Ice Cream Parlor located on First Avenue and 66th street in the 1980's.  I used to go there occasionally.  Peppermint Park was two blocks from Warner Leroy's famed Maxwell's Plum restaurant.  I'd love to see pictures of that.  </h2>
<p>Ah, I remember that place! I had a friend who lived close by. We couldn’t afford to go there much, but every once in a while, after saving our dimes and smoking a lot of good weed, we’d stumble in and buy something delicious.</p>
