<h2>I'm not American. On the one hand, I adore the NYC of the 70s and 80s just from a visual point of view. On the other hand, my friends who are older than me have told me about running for their lives from Street gangs in the city. And of those survival pamphlets handed out the airport to ensure tourists don't end up getting killed because the city was so bad. It's a difficult emotion to try and process for me.</h2>
<p>It was an ugly, dirty, dangerous, exciting, fascinating, beautiful place. </p>
