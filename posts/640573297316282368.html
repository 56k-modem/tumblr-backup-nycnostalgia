<h2><p>I'm trying to remember the name of an arthouse movie theater near Lincoln Center that was there in the late 80's. It was possibly located on Broadway near W 67th Street (around there). It's not Lincoln Plaza Cinemas. I remember seeing the film, Shoah, at this theatre. It may have had only one or two screens. Do you recall the name of this theater?</p></h2>
